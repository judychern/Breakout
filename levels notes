put each level into an array of leels

make a Level class and put your level array as a property of the class. Then fill your levels array with instances of each level

Then you can store additional pieces of info about each level

Just in case that comes in handy in the future

For instance maybe each increasing level makes the ball go faster or something so you store a speed with each level
iterate through each level
to progress

in the Game class - STILL use the method i'm using to detect if you beat a level
except i'm also applying the level iteration

Maybe each level could have a property to keep track of how many blocks are still alive then each iteration just check that value to see if it is 0

Update it every time a block collision is detected

Except count is a property of each level

but now you are putting a Level instance into the levels array

A Level has a property that holds the array in it

So technically levels would be an array of objects where each object has an array and some other values inside it
